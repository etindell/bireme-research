Playtech PLC

- ﻿﻿Fri, Nov 21, 2025﻿ Expert call with former CCO of Playtech USA
  - Gemini call structure
    - **Detailed Question List1. Introduction (5 min)**
      - Briefly describe the scope of your role as CCO of Playtech USA. Did you have visibility into global operations, or was it strictly ring-fenced to North America?
      - *Compliance Check:* Please refrain from sharing non-public material financial information or specific confidential client data.
    - **2. US Market Penetration & Strategy (10 min)**
    - **Market Entry:** How would you characterize Playtech's momentum in the US compared to initial internal expectations? What were the primary bottlenecks to faster expansion (e.g., licensing, studio build-outs, or operator demand)?
    - **Strategic Focus:** In the US, is Playtech leading with the **IMS Platform** (B2B backend) or **Live Casino** content? Which product is the more effective "Trojan Horse" to get into a Tier-1 US operator?
    - **Regulatory Moats:** You pioneered launches in NJ. How difficult is it for a new entrant (like Pragmatic) to replicate Playtech's regulatory infrastructure in states with strict live studio requirements (NJ, PA, MI)?
    - **3. Competitive Landscape: Playtech vs. Evolution (15 min)**
      - **Win/Loss Analysis:** In head-to-head RFPs for Live Casino in the US, how often does Playtech beat Evolution?
        - *Follow up:* When Playtech loses, is it due to product quality (latency/UI), game variety, or commercial terms?
      - **Product Parity:** Candidly, how does Playtech's Live Casino product compare to Evolution's Lightning series or Crazy Time? Is there a technology gap, or is it purely a brand perception gap?
      - **Dual-Sourcing:** Most US operators (FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM) use Evolution as their primary. What is the pitch to get them to add Playtech as a secondary supplier? Is it strictly for redundancy, or are there specific games driving the demand?
    - **4. Commercials, Contracts & Economics (15 min)**
      - **Pricing Power:** How does Playtech's revenue share model compare to Evolution's in the US? Is Playtech discounting heavily to gain market share?
      - **Renegotiations:** You mentioned involvement in renegotiating contracts. What are the biggest friction points with operators right now? Are operators pushing back on revenue share percentages?
      - **Studio Economics:** Can you walk through the unit economics of opening a new Live Studio in a state like Michigan? What is the break-even timeline, and how much volume (occupancy) is needed to make a table profitable?
    - **5. The IMS Platform & Switching Costs (10 min)**
      - **The "Sticky" Factor:** For operators using Playtech's IMS (Information Management System), how high are the switching costs? If an operator wanted to switch from IMS to a competitor (like GiG or bespoke), how long and painful is that migration?
      - **Bundling:** Does Playtech successfully bundle Live Casino with IMS? For example, "If you use our IMS, you get a discount on Live Casino tables."
      - **Tech Debt:** How does the IMS tech stack hold up against modern, microservices-based platforms? Is it viewed as a "legacy" system by US CTOs, or is it still best-in-class?
    - **6. Closing & Risks (5 min)**
      - **Bear Case:** If you were shorting Playtech stock, what would be your thesis? Where is the hidden fragility in the business model?
      - **Execution Risk:** What is the biggest internal challenge Playtech faces in scaling its US operations over the next 24 months?
      - **Pre-Call Prep for You (The User)**To get the most out of Marcus, keep these "Insider" dynamics in mind:
      - **The "Evolution Monopoly":** Evolution Gaming has historically dominated Live Casino. Marcus's job was essentially to break that monopoly. Push him on *exactly* how hard that was.
      - **The IMS/PAM Distinction:** Playtech isn't just games; they provide the "Player Account Management" (PAM) system called IMS. This is the operating system of the casino. It is much harder to rip out a PAM than it is to switch game providers. **Ask him if the IMS is the anchor that keeps clients from leaving.**
      - **US vs. Europe:** Playtech is a giant in Europe/Asia but a challenger in the US. Ensure his answers distinguish between "Global Playtech" (mature, cash cow) and "US Playtech" (startup mode, high investment).
    - **Next Step **Would you like me to generate a specific set of **"Red Flag" indicators** to listen for during the call that might suggest Playtech is struggling with US adoption?
  - ChatGPT structure
    - Overall objectives for the call
      - Focus the hour on things that actually move the valuation of Playtech PLC:
      - Quality and durability of Playtech Live & the platform (IMS / PAM+) – vs Evolution and Pragmatic.
      - Growth and profitability of B2B (especially Americas) – whether the strong 2024 numbers and US ramp are sustainable.
      - Management quality, culture, and risk (regulatory, legal, competitive) – including the Evolution/Black Cube dispute and what it signals.
      - Everything below (questions, ordering, emphasis) is my own suggested structure based on public info and educated judgment; factual statements are sourced where cited.

    - B2B EBITDA ex-Caliente is up from 90m in 2021 to 150m in 2024, guiding to 190m or so in the medium term
  - Valuation
    - Market cap of 750m GBP /  850 EUR
      - essentially no net debt
    - Core B2B business doing 150m of EBITDA = 1b GBP of value
      - probably 85m of EBIT is probably worth more than the current market cap (would be 5x EBITDA and 8x EBIT), where as Evolution AB trades for 8x EBITDA and 9x EBIT despite having >50% of revenue coming from unregulated markets (vs <20% for Playtech).
        - Maintenance capex is around 65m
      - Medium term guidance
        - 150m EBITDA to 275m over "medium term"
          - 15m US losses to go positive
          - 20m in underperforming market improvements
          - growth in regulated markets
    - Caliente stake probably worth 1b GBP
      - At 14x PE, Caliente would be worth 3.5b EUR
        - Q2 2025: 246m revenue and 62m net income
        - Therefore, annualized would be 1b EUR and 250m Operating Income
        - At 3.5b EUR valuation, Playtech stake would be 1.1b EUR. This is 20-30% higher than the current market cap.
        - Playtech received a 20m quarterly dividend from caliente corresponding to their Q2 share of profits.
      - Mexican B2B revenues grown tremendously over time (pre change of agreement)
      - Mexican gambling market set to grow 21% in 2025
      - Caliente uses Playtech IMS and various other products / games etc
      - ChatGPT values the stake at 1.1b GBP in a base case
  - Capital allocation / buyback / management purchases
    - Management buying back >200k shares per day plus 10m block

    - 30m share buyback auth from last annual meeting
    - Nov 11, management exercised options on 133k shares and said they were paying the taxes out of pocket. Taxes probably on the order of 100k GBP.
  - Management
    - The truth is that various actions by management are the reason for the price discount, but none of the decisions are about core business management but rather executive compensation and legal / regulatory strategy (EVO report)
    - Sold Snaitech for 2.3b EUR, 9x EBITDA, 3x initial investment
