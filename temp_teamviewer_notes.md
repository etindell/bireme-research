Teamviewer #TMV

- ﻿﻿Mon, Nov 24, 2025﻿ questions for management
  - Openers
    - **Oliver -- how have the last 6 years gone vs expectations?**
      - *company had a lot of expectations in terms of digitization of remote management but was not the most heavily followed industry. COVID brought a boom in revenues and a boom in the stock price but also increased competition and increased expectations. Growth investors sold in the 50s or 60s when the price spiked, and the investor based rolled over. Hiccups with 1E and move to single digit growth has created an air pocket.*
    - **Why they bought 1E**
      - *1E* *had a very good position in endpoint management in particular automated endpoint management, growing 15-20% pretty consistently. Also they were profitable which we liked. The main competitor in this area was NextThing but they were too big for us to buy. We ended up paying 8x sales because that 's what you have to pay for this sort of business, and we didn't want to get into an auction situation. We felt there was a really good opportunity to integrate this porduct into our sales team and also use things like AI support summaries for the traditional teamviewer product to feed into 1E's automated support and maintenance capabilities. 1E has a small number of customers, maybe 300 total at very large ACV to create their 70m of ARR. We made a few mistakes which included for example trying to bring the product downmarket to our larger SMB customers instead of executing on product roadmaps that 1E had been talking about with customers.*
    - What exactly do you want TeamViewer to be known for in 5–10 years?
    - Strategic priorities ranking
      - Question: If you had to rank your top three strategic priorities for the next 2–3 years (AI, 1E integration, OT expansion, enterprise move-up, etc.), what are they and why?
    - *Use this to acknowledge their recent wins before pivoting to the challenges.***"First, congratulations on being named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for DEX. That’s a major external validation, especially coming so soon after the 1E acquisition. Are you finding that this recognition is effectively shortening sales cycles with enterprise CIOs who might have previously viewed TeamViewer only as a remote support tool?"**
      - **Why ask this?** It validates their strategy and lets them start on a positive note. It also subtly tests if "prestige" is actually translating into "revenue" (which connects to your later questions about the 1E revenue stumble).
    - 2028 target -- can you still hit 1.05b EUR revenue with 44.5% margins 2028 targets?
    - Why did Permira drop out?
  - 1E integration and strategy
    - **Loss of employees at 1E**
      - *we lost some key salespeople at 1E, including some that had promised us they would stay. Although interestingly, 2 of the sales people have now returned which we think bodes well for us going forward. We lost some of the leadership that had been put in under PE ownership, but have replaced them with internal people that have been there for a long time and which we think are well placed to continue the growth of the company. Nothing that has happened makes us question the long term trajectory for this business.*
    - how can i get comfortable with the trajectory of 1E vs competitors?
    - Pipeline
      - "With 1E performing below expectations, what gives you confidence in the Q4 turnaround? Are you seeing existing TeamViewer enterprise customers actually piloting 1E products, or is the cross-sell motion still theoretical at this stage?"
    - DEX competition
      - Why was 1E winning historically? Why do customers choose 1E / teamviewer?
      - The DEX space is crowded with specialized players like Nexthink and giants like Microsoft Intune. If 1E is struggling to grow on its own, what is the specific 'right to win' when bundled with TeamViewer? Why would a CIO choose your bundled solution over a native Microsoft integration?"
    - **Will we be able to track 1E revenue growth over the next few years or will it get absorbed in the larger financials?**
      - *it will not be split out*
    - **What kind of growth at 1E did you expect to pay 10x sales or whatever the price was?**
      - *10-15% growth going forward*
    - Do you see uptake from SMBs on 1E, or is it solely Enterprise?
  - Guidance
    - Cost cutting -- are we cutting into sales and R&D muscle that is needed to fix the 1E growth problem?
  - SMB segment
    - SMB vs Enterprise -- can you talk me through the 15m euro upsell?
      - 
    - Have we hit a ceiling on SMB price raises? 
      - *entry level -- lots of competition w splashtop etc*
      - *no point to lower price at the low end*
      - *above 1500 eur ACV is very different and we see less competition at that level*
      - *used to take price at contract renewal, going to correct going forward*
    - How are cheaper rivals like Splashtop affecting your business? 
    - Churn -- 14% to 16%
    - Is the best way to think of the SMB segment is as shrinking in the low end?
    - How would you compare the Atera and NinjaOne remote monitoring / management products in terms of value to price? Is Teamviewer Remote losing relevance as a standalone product?
      - ChatGPT thoughts
        - TMV still the leader
        - NinjaOne no longer supporting Teamviewer inside its solution
          - 
        - NinjaOne costs $3.75 but its per endpoint rather than per user, not clear that its better if you have more than 3 endpoints per user
          - 
        - Teamviewer still rated highly in remote access
          - 
  - Enterprise 
    - Can you walk me through a typical Enterprise customer sales pitch? Say its a European company with a few thousand employees. 
    - **What Enterprise likes**
      - *full access , manageability, open to outside the org, integration into SSO, ServiceNow, etc Teamviewer core is remote support remote tool*
  - Capital allocation /other
    - **What's the priority for buybacks vs M&A goin forward**
      - *Priority for now is deleveraging*
    - Why did Permira sell?
  - AI and innovation
    - "I saw the recent data on 'TeamViewer Intelligence'—specifically the 4x growth in AI session summaries. That is impressive adoption. As you move toward 'agentic AI' and autonomous support, do you see this primarily as a retention tool to keep customers sticky, or is there a clear path to monetizing these AI features as a standalone revenue stream in 2026?"
    - **What's the technology stack behind TMV Intelligence (session summaries, Copilot etc)**
      - *they use OpenAI via Microsoft. Like to use Microsoft where they can due to existing relationships. 1E also works well with MSFT Intune*
    - Do you expect AI-specific products and services can become a material revenue generator? Or will they be free add-ons that increase retention?
    - Is session summarization the primary AI product here?
    - Frontline (AR/VR) seems to have taken a backseat growthwise. Is it still a growth pillar, or is it more niche?
    - Press release [here](https://ir.teamviewer.com/news-details/teamviewer-reports-rapid-customer-adoption-of-its-al-offering/b47fd872-09ab-4927-b25c-67f02c379004)
